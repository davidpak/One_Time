        <div class="explanation-box">
            <p>The <strong>One Time</strong> is possibly the most powerful thing someone can give to you. The One Time allows the user to
            make one irrefutable request to the person of interest (David). Of course, there are boundaries so please just use your common sense. </br>
            Here is a list of things that the One Time does not have the power to do: 
            <div class="list">
                
            <ul>
                <li>Make David do something illegal</li>
                <li>Make David do something that would cause anyone physical harm</li>
                <li>Make David do something that would cause anyone emotional harm</li>
                <li>Make David do something that would cause anyone financial harm</li>
                <li>Make David do something that would cause anyone spiritual harm</li>
                <li>Make David do something that would cause anyone mental harm</li>
                <li>Make David do something that would cause anyone social harm</li>
                <li>Make David do something that would cause anyone any other type of harm</li>
            </div>
